/**
 * @zakkster/lite-bvh -- torture gate.
 *
 * The DONE-WHEN of every session is a single command:
 *
 *     node --expose-gc test/torture.mjs        -> prints exactly "ok", exit 0
 *     npm run torture
 *
 * Ten tiers share one shape (see the roadmap section 3). B0 stands up the
 * harness and wires the tiers this package needs now:
 *
 *     T0  metamorphic laws          t3  adversarial insert orders
 *     T1  degenerate query values   t4  handle / buffer / input abuse
 *     T6  the zero-alloc gate       t7  soak + free-list conservation
 *     T8  cross-package poison door  t9  controls (must be able to fail)
 *
 * T2 (aliasing) and T5 (differential fuzz) are reserved for later sessions and
 * intentionally not registered here. T8 is wired as of B2 (poison quarantine).
 *
 * lite-gc-profiler is one-measurement-at-a-time, so tiers run STRICTLY
 * SEQUENTIALLY -- never nested, never concurrent.
 *
 * Controls: `BVH_TORTURE_BREAK=1 node --expose-gc test/torture.mjs` injects
 * retained allocations into the T6 hot loop and must exit non-zero. A gate that
 * cannot fail is decorative.
 *
 * Peers (lite-gc-profiler, lite-leak) are devDependencies only. Bvh.js has zero
 * runtime dependencies.
